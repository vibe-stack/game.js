# Game.js Framework Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Core Framework Setup âœ…
- [x] Analyzed existing monorepo structure  
- [x] Create core package structure
- [x] Implement Scene base class
- [x] Implement decorators for editor integration
- [x] Implement Router with file-based routing
- [x] Implement RendererManager singleton
- [x] Implement AssetLoader

## Phase 2: Vite Plugin âœ…
- [x] Create vite-plugin package
- [x] Implement route discovery and generation
- [x] Implement HMR support for scenes

## Phase 3: CLI Tool âœ…
- [x] Create CLI package
- [x] Implement create command
- [x] Implement basic project scaffolding
- [x] Template generation with example scene

## Phase 4: Example Implementation âœ…
- [x] Create basic-game example using CLI
- [x] Test complete workflow
- [x] Verify hot reloading functionality
- [x] Fix TypeScript integration issues
- [x] Resolve Vite plugin import path issues

## Current Status
ðŸŽ‰ **COMPLETE!** All phases successfully implemented and tested.

The game.js framework is fully functional with:
- Working CLI that generates new projects
- Proper workspace integration with monorepo
- TypeScript compilation without errors
- Vite development server with hot reloading
- Automatic route generation from file structure

## Architecture Overview
- **@game.js/core**: Scene system, router, renderer manager, asset loader
- **@game.js/vite-plugin**: Route generation, HMR support
- **@game.js/cli**: Project scaffolding and templates

## Key Features Implemented
- File-based routing (like Next.js)
- @Editable decorators for future editor integration
- Singleton renderer management
- Scene lifecycle hooks (init, update, cleanup, onEnter, onExit)
- Hot reloading support
- Asset caching and management
- CLI project creation

## Testing Results
âœ… CLI successfully creates new projects
âœ… Generated projects install dependencies correctly  
âœ… TypeScript compilation passes
âœ… Vite development server starts successfully
âœ… Routes are automatically generated from scene files
âœ… Framework ready for Three.js game development

## Next Steps for Future Development
- Add more scene templates (3D models, physics, etc.)
- Implement the Electron editor for visual editing
- Add more asset loaders (GLTF, textures, sounds)
- Enhance HMR with scene state preservation
- Add production build optimizations
